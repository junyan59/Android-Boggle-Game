* The user interface should be intuitive and responsive.
* The screen should be at least 3” diagonal (ideally larger) to be able to effectively view the application
* When the game board resizes due to changes to the settings (for example, 4x4 to 5x5), the new gameboard size shouldn’t materially impact gameplay (for example, shift the other buttons to new locations or make the letters difficult to read, etc)
* The game should run smoothly without noticeable lag between their actions and the response of the application.
* The game should not interrupt or use resources from the device in a way that makes materially impacts other applications running on the device
* Game should play well on a reasonable number of different phone sizes (assuming a large enough screen)
