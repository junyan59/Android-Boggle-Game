## 1 Introduction

Develop a word game app on the Android platform similar to the board game Boggle. The game allows the user to generate a letter board based on selected parameters, the user then inputs words made up from the letters showing on the board to acquire scores as rewards.

## 2 Process Description

#### Process:

* Requirements: D0
* Analysis & Design: D1, D2
* Implementation: D3, D4
* Test & Revisions: D3, D4
* Deployment: D4

#####  D1 - Analysis & Design

Our team met and discussed the best way to attack this project.  We discussed each of our UML designs and decided on a final verion, which was a mix of ideas from all four members.  

* *Entrance criteria*: Review and understand the requirements of the project
* *Exit criteria*: The key components including classes, attributes, operations, and relationships for the system are been identified and refined. Major design decisions discussed and approved by all four team members.

##### D2 - Inception and Elaboration

We decided on roles for each member - each person has at least two different roles with some overlap.  
* We split up duties based on roles and worked on the required documents:
  * Project plan - Showing project development process and roles
  * Use-case model - Behavior diagram in UML
  * Extra requirements - Requirements that do not fit the use-case model
  * Design document - Design consideration, UI design, and Class Diagram
  * Test plan without results - Initial test plans with strategy, selections, technology, and test cases
* *Entrance criteria*: Major design decision formed. UML design accomplished.
* *Exit criteria*: The documents and plans that elaborated from the initial design are detailed enough for implementation.

##### D3 - Construction

Our goal in this phase will be to develop an alpha/beta version of the application. Most of our time will be spent writing code and fixing fixing errors and bugs that are found during testing.  We will also fill our our test plan with possibly partial results, making use of JUnit to automate whenever possible.  If needed, we plan to revise our documents generated in D2 to resemble our code.

* Entrance criteria: Plans are sufficient for the construction, no big holes in the logic and designs.
* Exit criteria: Initial application main functions works as designed, JUnit test passed.

##### D4 - Final Transition

In the final phase, will will deliver the final working version of the application, along with our final revised documents that reflect the changes made for the design during D3 and D4.  Our test plan will be completed with  final results. We are hoping to achieve 100% passing scores for all tests. 	

* Entrance criteria: Initial application worked out, no major issues from function and performance.
* Exit criteria: Final working version of the application passed espresso tests
